1.Define core functionality
- The app should store details of books in a list of display cards
- The UI should have buttons to add a book
- New book added via a modal
- The display cards should have a remove button and a confirmation message if clicked accidendily
- User should be able to categorise books by assigning them a shelf
- user should be able to create and delete their own shelves
- user should be able to filter current display cards by shelves

2. Model
- stores book objects
    - book objects include data:
        - title
        - author
        - user rating
        - shelf
        - review
- stores shelves defined by user
    - default shelves are:
        - all
        - finished
3. View
- Nav bar
- container for cards (book cards are classes)
- card(s) representing books
- confirmation to delete modal when delete clicked on card
- add books button
- add books modal 
- shelves container
    - shelf items - filter cards when clicked (shelf buttons can be classes)
- remove filter button
- add shelf button
- remove sheves button 
    - shows x buttons next to each shelf item
- confirmation modal for delete shelf

4. Controller
model manages state
- notifies view when changes occur
view handles UI updates
- binds UI events
Controller handles user actions
    - listens to button clicks
    - calls model methods to add shelves, books, remove books, or remove shelves

Written as a proof of concept to implement classes in JS.
